🔥 Lengua del Fuego
A fusion of tender beef tongue and Al Pastor-inspired adobo, simmered in ancestral spices & kissed with sage.
🧂 Ingredients:
•	1.66 lb beef tongue
•	3 bay leaves
•	1 ancho chile (stemmed & seeded)
•	2 guajillo chiles (stemmed & seeded)
•	4 medium garlic cloves (smashed)
•	⅔ large red onion, chopped
•	½ medium yellow onion, chopped
•	2 whole cloves (spice buds)
•	15 crushed Juniper Seeds
•	1 tsp cumin
•	1 tsp oregano
•	½ tsp paprika
•	Pinch of sage
•	Optional: ½ cup pineapple juice with fresh pineapple chunks
•	Optional: 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
•	Water to cover
🍲 Instructions:
1.	Place beef tongue in a large pot and cover with water.
2.	Add all ingredients to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer.
3.	Simmer for 2–3 hours until tongue is tender.
4.	Remove tongue, let cool slightly, then peel and trim.
5.	Slice into ¼-inch pieces. Sauté in oil until lightly crisped, or toss with strained broth for extra flavor.
6.	Serve in warm corn tortillas with charred pineapple, pickled red onions, cilantro, and lime.
🪶 Notes:

•	This simplified adobo-style broth infuses the meat with warmth and complexity.
